Hello! Glad you found this file,
This git repository is specifically for showing off the code behind the projects that I've been working on.
To reduce space, I have removed some assets sucha as large images, redundant packages, and audio files.
But you should be able to view the completed versions of these projects on my portfolio website: joe-cowan.com
Here is a quick description of these projects:

connect-four:
  An exploration / excersize in both basic OOJS and game developement.
  
world-builder:
  A react project for managing a world-building archive.

portfolio-min:
  This is a dumbed down version of the website hosted at www.joe-cowan.com
